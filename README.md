# Surrogate Modelling for Time Of Flight Diffraction of Rough Defects 

Hello and welcome to the code of the paper "Surrogate Modelling for Time Of Flight Diffraction of Rough Defects". 


This GitHub repository collects all the code that has been used in the study made by Piero Paialunga and Joseph Corcoran at the __University Of Cincinnati__.

The structure of the code is the following: 

1. __Importing and Preprocessing__ the data
2. Implementation of the Machine Learning model for the __full A-Scan reconstruction__ (CNN+RNN)
3. Implementation of the Machine Learning model for the __main peak prediction__ (RNN)
4. Matlab code description for the __defect generation__
5. Training of the __full A scan model__
6. Training of the __main peak prediction model__
7. __Testing of the models__ on the new generated defects
8. __Plotting and reporting__ of the results. 

## 1. Importing and Preprocessing
